	\section{Introduction}
	\begin{frame}{Introduction}
		
		Policing agencies have setup vast networks of distributed surveillance cameras along major routes. The sheer amount of data generated is overwhelming for manual analysis, to trace routes of rouge vehicles.\\~\\
				
		DragonFly is an AI based project that aims to resolve this particular issue. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The user provides the system with vehicle descriptions such as color, make,
			model, location, time-period etc. 
			\item The system finds corresponding match by makinguse of various AI techniques. 
			\item The system tries to re-identify the said vehicle across multiple camera locations.
			\item The system finds the path followed by the said vehiclealong with the detected frame at each camera points.
		\end{itemize}
