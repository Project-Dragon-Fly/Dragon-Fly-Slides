Efficient and Deep Vehicle Re-Identification UsingMulti-Level Feature Extraction

First we shortlist the vehicle from a gallery set on thebasis of  appearance, and then in the second step we verify the shortlisted vehicleâ€™s license plates witha query image to identify the targeted vehicle. In our model, the global channel extracts the featurevector from the whole vehicle image, and the local region channel extracts more discriminative and salient features from different regions. In addition to this, we jointly incorporate attributes like model,type, and color, etc.


Hence, extracted visual
features should be more discriminative and capable of representing some salient identification marks,such as decoration stickers, annual inspection marks, etc. [12].

The multi-branch networkconsisted of two different blocks to learn labels: (1) A backbone network responsible for extractingappearance features consisting of a dense block. (2) A two-branch network responsible for extractingmodel and color features consisting of a coffee-net and inception block, respectively.
